Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to send and receive short messages called tweets, reflectiing how people respond to events in real time.

Technologies Used
•	Python– Core language for data processing and analysis.
•	Tweepy – Fetches tweets via Twitter API.
•	NLTK & TextBlob – NLP tools for text preprocessing and sentiment scoring.
•	VADER – Specialized for social media sentiment analysis.
•	scikit-learn – Machine learning models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)..
•	Pandas – Data manipulation.
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.

Components
1. Data Collection
•	Tweets are fetched using Tweepy via the Twitter API.
•	Data is gathered based on keywords, hashtags, or user accounts.
•	Preprocessing involves cleaning text by removing special characters, links, stopwords, and tokenizing words.

3. Sentiment Analysis Methods
•	Lexicon-Based Approach: Uses sentiment scoring tools like VADER and TextBlob.
•	Machine Learning Approach: Classifies sentiment using models like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
•	Deep Learning Approach (Optional): Utilizes LSTMs or transformer-based models like BERT for improved accuracy.

3.Implementation Steps
.Data Collection – Retrieve and preprocess tweets.
.	Preprocessing – Remove unnecessary elements (special characters, URLs, stopwords).
.	Feature Extraction – Convert text into numerical representations using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
.	Model Training & Evaluation – Train and test ML models for sentiment classification.
.	Visualization – Use Matplotlib & Seaborn to generate graphs and insights.

4. Expected Outcomes
•	Accurate classification of tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
•	Identification of trending topics and public opinions.
•	Actionable insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers.
